# Regenerate the home-screen tile's cover art (documents/Steb.sh).
#
# A `documents/*.sh` scriptlet is indexed as a library tile, and the framework
# draws whatever PNG its `# Icon:` header carries as a base64 data URI. That
# header is one ~21KB line, so it is generated rather than hand-edited.
#
# Pipeline: assets/cover.svg -> render -> shrink -> assets/cover.png -> base64
# -> the `# Icon:` line. Each step takes the first tool it finds — rsvg-convert
# or resvg to render, pngquant or oxipng to shrink — so a machine with only the
# Rust toolchain (`cargo install resvg oxipng`) can still regenerate the tile.
# Every tool is optional; without a renderer the committed PNG is reused, and
# the script says which step it skipped.
#
# This rewrites ONLY the `# Icon:` line. The shebang, the other headers and the
# script body are left untouched, so the scriptlet stays a normal file you can
# edit by hand — run this after changing the cover, not after changing the body.

# Usage: device/make-tile.sh
