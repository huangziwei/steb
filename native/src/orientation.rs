//! Display + touch orientation handling.
//!
//! The KOA2 framework rotates the screen 180° based on which side the
//! page-turn bezel is on (accelerometer-driven). Our binary writes raw
//! framebuffer pixels and reads raw evdev touch events — neither honors
//! the framework's rotation. We detect the framework's current orientation
//! at startup and apply a 180° transform to both fb writes and touch
//! reads so the user-visible UI is right-side-up regardless of grip.
//!
//! v1 scope: detect once at startup. Mid-session rotation (user flips the
//! device after Steb is running) is unsupported — the framework redraws
//! over us and we don't track the change. Documented in the bundle README.
