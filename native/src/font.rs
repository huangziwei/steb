//! Font fallback: which face draws which character.
//!
//! **Steb draws Latin.** Standard Ebooks publishes English-language books, so
//! there is no second script to reconcile and [`discover`] yields Latin faces
//! only — a CJK face would never draw a glyph here.
//!
//! What remains is a fallback *chain*, which still earns its keep: an English
//! catalogue is not pure ASCII (accented author names, classical titles,
//! transliterated Russian), and the chain is what stops an uncovered character
//! rendering as `.notdef`.
//!
//! The per-script selection machinery below is consequently vestigial — every
//! candidate is [`Script::Unknown`], and Steb has no language tags to pass, so
//! nothing is ever promoted and [`discover`]'s order simply stands. It is
//! kept rather than torn out because `text.rs` and `grid.rs` are inherited
//! intact and take a `Script` in their signatures; deleting the type would fork
//! those modules to no benefit. It costs nothing at runtime.
//!
//! How a face gets picked, on its own terms:
//!
//! A face is chosen per string, not per character, so a run cannot end up drawn
//! from two faces with visibly different shapes. It drops to per-character only
//! when no single face covers the run.
//!
//! Coverage alone cannot decide everything, because it only ever sees what a
//! face *lacks*. A caller that knows the language can pass it in
//! ([`Script::of_language`]) and the chain is tried in that order; the hint only
//! *reorders*, so coverage still decides which face actually draws and a missing
//! or wrong tag costs shapes, never glyphs.
//!
//! Fallback faces are read on first miss, never at startup. A loaded face costs
//! its file size in resident bytes, so everything after the first entry is free
//! unless a character actually needs it — which, for this catalogue, is the
//! expected case. (The rasterizer outlines a glyph when asked rather than the
//! whole cmap up front, so reading the file is the entire cost.)
//!
//! The selection policy is a free function over a coverage oracle so it can
//! be exercised on the host, where none of these faces exist.
