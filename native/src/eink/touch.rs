//! evdev touchscreen reader.
//!
//! Multi-touch protocol B: the kernel emits a stream of `input_event`
//! records with absolute X/Y plus a tracking-ID lifecycle. We surface
//! two boundary events per contact — `Down` (finger lands) and `Up`
//! (finger lifts) — so the long-press path can time the gap. Move
//! events between the boundaries silently update `cur_x/cur_y`;
//! pinch/scroll are out of scope.
//!
//! Per-contact wire ordering inside one `SYN_REPORT` packet:
//!   ABS_MT_SLOT 0
//!   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID <id≥0>   ← contact begins (Down packet)
//!   ABS_MT_POSITION_X / Y
//!   SYN_REPORT
//!   …move packets…
//!   ABS_MT_SLOT 0
//!   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID -1       ← contact ends (Up packet)
//!   SYN_REPORT
//!
//! We collect `down_pending` / `up_pending` flags as the events stream
//! in and emit the boundary at `SYN_REPORT` so the position fields are
//! correctly populated for the matching event.
//!
//! Device discovery: `/proc/bus/input/devices` is text. Name-matching alone is
//! brittle across panels — KOA2 reports "cyttsp", the Colorsoft reports
//! "fts_ts" (FocalTech) — so capability matters too: a touchscreen advertises
//! absolute axes (`EV_ABS`) and is a direct device (`INPUT_PROP_DIRECT`).
//! We extract its `eventN` handler; no `EVIOCGNAME` ioctl needed.
//!
//! Capability alone is *not* sufficient, and the Scribe is why. It carries a
//! Wacom EMR pen digitizer alongside the finger panel, and a pen on a screen is
//! every bit as `EV_ABS` + `INPUT_PROP_DIRECT` as a finger is. Taking the first
//! capable node grabbed `wacomdigitizer`, and because we `EVIOCGRAB` what we
//! open, that both blinded the picker to touch and starved the framework of pen
//! input — the device could only be recovered by rebooting.
//!
//! So discovery *scores* every node and takes the best, rather than returning
//! the first that clears a bar. Pen/stylus digitizers are excluded outright;
//! everything else is ranked by how much it looks like a finger panel. Scoring
//! rather than filtering is deliberate: a heuristic that ranks wrongly costs a
//! preference, while one that filters wrongly costs the only usable device.
//!
//! Wire format: on the KOA2's kernel (4.1.15, 32-bit ARM), each event is
//! 16 bytes — `struct timeval` is 8 bytes, then u16 type, u16 code,
//! i32 value. We parse from raw bytes so the host (cargo check on macOS,
//! where libc::c_long is 8 bytes) and the target stay byte-compatible.
