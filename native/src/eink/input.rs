//! Input multiplexer: wait on the touchscreen and the bezel page-button device
//! at once via `poll(2)`, surfacing a unified event so the main loop handles
//! both without threads or channels.
//!
//! Why poll rather than two read loops: the main loop can only block in one
//! place, and it must wake for *either* device. `poll(2)` blocks until one fd
//! is readable, then we drain the ready one without blocking on the other.
//! `Buttons::read_one` reads exactly one record (poll already guaranteed it's
//! present). `Touch::next_event` is non-blocking (its fd is `O_NONBLOCK`): it
//! drains the currently-available events and returns `None` if they don't
//! complete a Down/Up boundary, in which case we re-poll — so a touch stroke
//! mid-flight can't block the loop and starve the button fd.
