//! `--probe-x`: dump everything that could explain why one panel refreshes and
//! another does not, in a form two devices can be diffed against each other.
//!
//! The renderer assumes the X server turns damage into an eink refresh by
//! itself, so the caller need not ask for one. Where that does not hold,
//! drawing is correct and the screen is still stale, and no adjustment to *how*
//! pixels are uploaded reaches it.
//!
//! So the questions here are deliberately about the mechanism, not our usage:
//! which extensions the server offers (an eink/refresh extension being the thing
//! we would otherwise never think to call), what the real request limits are,
//! whether a full-screen upload succeeds and how long the server takes to
//! acknowledge it, and whether the classic framebuffer refresh paths still exist
//! underneath. Run it on a device that works and on one that doesn't; the diff is
//! the answer.

/// reports every one of those uploads as successful. The framebuffer is the
/// stage *after* X and before the panel, so reading it says which uploads
/// reached panel memory and, more usefully, the exact geometry of whatever went
/// wrong. Two candidate causes leave different fingerprints:
///
/// - **Stride.** The panel's line stride is 1872 while X calls the screen 1860
///   wide. If anything writes rows at the wrong pitch, each successive row slips
///   sideways by 12px and the damage is a shear — coverage falling off gradually
///   down a square, and content displaced horizontally.
/// - **Update-region limits.** An eink controller accepts a bounded number of
///   concurrent update rectangles. Run out and whole squares vanish while
///   partially-processed ones are cut across a row — coverage that is 100% or 0%
///   per square, with a clean horizontal edge on the casualties.
