//! The native Kindle two-corner screenshot gesture, reimplemented for Steb.
//!
//! On stock firmware a simultaneous opposite-corner tap captures the screen to
//! a PNG. That recognizer never fires under Steb: we hold an exclusive
//! `EVIOCGRAB` on the touchscreen (see [`super::touch`]), so the framework —
//! recognizer included — sees no touch events while we're foreground. So we
//! recognize the gesture ourselves in `touch.rs` (it has the multi-touch state
//! and the screen dimensions) and capture here. The capture itself is cheap:
//! `Framebuffer`'s backing buffer already holds exactly what's on screen, so a
//! screenshot is just encoding it (plus a white flash for the "got it" cue).
