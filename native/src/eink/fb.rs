//! Display surface — a WM-managed fullscreen X11 window.
//!
//! Drawing goes through the window rather than a `/dev/fb0` mmap, so the
//! lab126 compositor owns the surface: it shows us fullscreen and recomposites
//! the whole screen — home library and status bar — when the window is torn
//! down on exit. Nothing here freezes or paints over the framework.
//!
//! The compositor ALSO auto-rotates our window 180° to the framework
//! orientation (page-bezel side), so we render identity here and never rotate
//! pixels ourselves — doing so would double-rotate. Touch/buttons are read raw
//! from evdev (panel-fixed), so the main loop re-orients *those* on rotation;
//! see [`crate::eink::input`]. The renderer draws into a packed-RGB backing
//! ([`CH`] bytes/pixel, white=255). The chrome (text, frames, bands) writes gray
//! via [`Framebuffer::put_pixel`] / [`Framebuffer::fill_rect`] (R=G=B), while
//! cover art writes true color via [`Framebuffer::put_pixel_rgb`] — so the
//! Colorsoft shows color covers under a grayscale UI.
//!
//! How the backing reaches the server depends on the window depth: a color panel
//! (Colorsoft — `/dev/fb0` is 32bpp, X runs depth 24/32) takes the RGB reordered
//! to the visual's channel masks plus a pad byte; a grayscale panel (KOA2, depth
//! 8) takes a per-pixel luma collapse (a gray UI pixel passes through exactly;
//! the rare color cover desaturates). `send_update` does that conversion per
//! band. A paint goes as one request (BIG-REQUESTS), so the server sees one
//! damage region rather than several. Type/
//! method names (`Framebuffer`, `MxcfbRect`, `send_update`) are kept so the
//! renderer is unchanged; the X server drives the eink refresh, so the waveform
//! is ignored.
