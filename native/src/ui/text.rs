//! Text rasterization onto the framebuffer.
//!
//! Glyphs come from a fallback chain over the faces the device already ships
//! (see [`crate::font`]), outlined one at a time at a fixed size via
//! ab_glyph. The rasterizer reports per-pixel coverage; we threshold it to
//! 1-bit because eink's DU waveform is B/W and antialiased gray smears on the
//! panel. Coverage above 96/255 becomes a black pixel, below stays white.
//! Crisp at small sizes; would need GC16 + dithering for true grayscale text.
//!
//! A character no face in the chain has draws a deliberate hollow box.
//! Handing it to the rasterizer instead blits the font's own `.notdef`,
//! whose hairline outline mostly falls *under* the coverage threshold — what
//! reaches the panel is a bar and two stray dots, which reads as data
//! corruption rather than as a missing glyph.
//!
//! Glyphs are cached per (codepoint, px, face) because rasterization isn't
//! free and CJK titles repeat characters often. The face belongs in the key:
//! two faces rasterize the same codepoint to different shapes.
