//! On-screen keyboard — the search overlay.
//!
//! A plain QWERTY grid: tap letters and digits, hit `[ Search ]` to run the
//! search or `[ Back ]` to leave without one.
//!
//! Latin-only is not a limitation here, it is the domain: Standard Ebooks
//! publishes English-language books, so the ~26 letters and ten digits cover
//! every title and author name someone would type.
//!
//! Layout follows a physical keyboard rather than a phone: there is a number
//! row, so `Del` sits at its right end where a keyboard puts Backspace. The
//! screen-level commands are not keys — they live in a bottom strip with the
//! same geometry and grammar as [`crate::ui::filtermenu`] and
//! [`crate::ui::pager`].
//!
//! Two of those commands leave the overlay and they are not the same thing.
//! `[ Search ]` is this keyboard's Enter: it submits, and sits at the far right
//! where a keyboard puts Enter. `[ Back ]` abandons, returning the query the
//! overlay opened with, and takes the leftmost slot — the one the gallery gives
//! `Exit`. Without it the only way out committed a search, so an overlay opened
//! by accident had to be paid for with one.
//!
//! Same blocking-sub-loop shape as [`crate::ui::filtermenu`] / [`crate::ui::sortmenu`]:
//! it owns input while open, full GC16 on open / page / rotate, and a single-band
//! DU on a keystroke so typing doesn't flash the whole panel. All key labels are
//! ASCII (`Del`/`Clear`/`space`/`[ Back ]`/`[ Search ]`) — no glyph-coverage
//! risk, same discipline as `ui::diag`.
